# DLF Meeting Repository

This repository contains the raw markdown text of the monthly and quarterly meeting summaries posted in the D forums. It is here primarily so that DLF staff and contributors can easily go back and review what was discussed.

Each file includes a link to the relevant forum post.

__NOTE__: Though these days I tend to do all revisions in the markdown file before hitting the submit button in the forums, I often revised the older summaries directly in the forum submission form while previewing the posts. On top of that, I'm missing some of the original markdown files. As such, I'm building up the respository one post at a time to ensure that the text here matches exactly the text in the forums.

__NOTE__: We used to hold quarterly meetings combined with the monthly meeting for the given month. Those file names for those meetings are prevised with 'quarterly-monthly`.
